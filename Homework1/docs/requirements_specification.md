## Descriptive Narrative

The Stock Market Analysis system serves as a crucial tool for collecting and managing historical stock data from the Macedonian Stock Exchange. Upon initialization, the system identifies relevant stock symbols and systematically retrieves historical data spanning a decade. The data pipeline employs a series of filters to ensure data quality and consistency.

The system first scrapes the MSE website for stock information, carefully validating and transforming the data before storage. It maintains data integrity through robust error handling and validation processes. The processed data is stored in a MySQL database while also being exported to CSV and Excel formats for accessibility.

Users can rely on the system to maintain up-to-date records, with the ability to perform incremental updates as new data becomes available. The system's modular design allows for future enhancements and features, making it a valuable tool for both system administrators and data analysts working with MSE data.
